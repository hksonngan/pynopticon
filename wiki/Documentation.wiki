#summary Tutorials on Pynopticon for using the GUI, the library and developing your own Pynopticon modules.

* For Beginners - Tutorial on using the GUI to build a quick object recognition pipeline.

Make sure you have Pynopticon and Orange installed correctly and linked the two together (read the [Installation] instructions). For the theoretical background on what each step in the pipeline does read the [Introduction].

 * From the toolbar choose the tab titled _Pynopticon_.
 * First, we need an input module to load some data to be processed - drag the widget _!ImageLoader _ onto the workspace.
 * Next, we want to choose which data we want our classifier to train on - double click on the new _!ImageLoader _ widget on the workspace.
 * For testing purposes lets choose a predefined dataset - click on the button _Load Dataset _ in the _!ImageLoader _ widget.
 * Select the file called _Caltech_small.xml_ and click on _Open_.
 * You can see two new categories, you can click on them and see the individual images, if you double click on them the image gets displayed.
 * Next we want to extract some features - drag the _SIFT_ widget onto the workspace.
 * Since we want to extract the features from our dataset click and hold on the little square on the right of the _!ImageLoader _ widget. You can now connect the output of this widget to input of the _SIFT_ widget by moving the line to little square on the left of the _SIFT_ widget.
