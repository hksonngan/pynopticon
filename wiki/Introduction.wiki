#summary Goals and design principles of Pynopticon.

= Overview =

The Documentation is separated into the following sub categories according to your background and goals with Pynopticon.

* Introduction - Informations about the general approach.

* For Beginners - Easy examples about the use of the GUI and how to get quickly going.

* For Advanced Users - Examples on how to use Pynopticon without a GUI.

* For Developers - Documentation and a tutorial on how to create your own widgets.


== Introduction ==
Pynopticon allows you to do object recognition on images following a Bag of Features (BoF) approach. This approach is in the computer vision community well established, yields good overall results and is applicable to a wide range of object recognition problems.

=== Bag of Features approach ===

The BoF approach works in essence by extracting various features from an image. Commonly used features are either global (e.g. Color Histograms on the whole image) or local (e.g. extracting Regions of Interest (RoI) and transforming them (one example of this approach is SIFT - Scale Invariant Feature Transform)).

In the next step these features can be clustered according to their simlarity under the assumption that classes of features provide information about the contents of an image. E.g. when classifying images with animals on them one might extract lots of local features with eyes on them, all these eyes are then grouped together during the clustering. So when you then have a new image where there are lots of extracted features in the eye category it is likely that there is an animal on the picture. Looking up in what cluster a feature lies is called 'quantization'. Counting how many features lie in a certain cluster results in a histogram.
